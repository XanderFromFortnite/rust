# Python-Xander
*A terminal-based Python tool made by.. you guess it, **Xander**

This only supports **Windows**, **Linux**

**MacOS** soon.

This tool can work if it has python (python3) installed, duh 

If you wanna try Python-Xander, run **start.py** on linux via terminal and **startwindows.py** on windows

Wanna help?
