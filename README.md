# [Python](https://www.python.org)-[Xander](https://wlo.link/@DefenderXander)
*A terminal-based Python tool made by.. you guess it, **Xander**

This only supports **Windows**, **Linux**

**MacOS** soon.

This tool can work if it has Python ([Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3113/)) installed, duh 

If you wanna try Python-Xander, run **start.py** on linux via terminal and **startwindows.py** on windows via.... whatever, I dont use windows.

Wanna help?
